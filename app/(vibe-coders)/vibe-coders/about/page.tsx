          <p>There are 40 million informal entrepreneurs in Nigeria. Most of them are paying developers they cannot fully communicate with, to build products they cannot maintain, using tools they do not understand.</p>

          <p>This is not a failure of intelligence. It is a failure of infrastructure — educational infrastructure that was never designed to serve them.</p>

          <p>Vibe Coders is not a bootcamp. We do not use that word. A bootcamp implies military conditioning toward a fixed output. We are something different: a <strong style={{ color: "#EDE8DC" }}>circle</strong>. A place where you build alongside people who look like the problem they are trying to solve.</p>

          <p>The program is 6 months. The first 2 months, you learn the stack — not to become a senior engineer, but to become sovereign enough to build your first real thing. The last 4 months, you build it. With mentors who check in, with a cohort that holds you accountable, with AI tools that multiply your output.</p>

          <p>We chose the stack deliberately: Next.js because it is where the world is going. Supabase because it removes the backend barrier. Cursor and Claude Code because they are the honest future of how code gets written. Paystack because it is ours.</p>

          <p style={{ fontStyle: "italic", color: "rgba(237,232,220,0.5)" }}>
            "Code that cannot feed your village has no roots."
          </p>

          <p>Every module has a business layer. Every deliverable is a real thing that could be shown to a real user. We do not teach you to pass a test. We teach you to ship.</p>

          <p>The psychology-informed application process is not bureaucracy. It is respect. We want to know who you are before we ask you to trust us with 6 months of your life. The deep assessment is not a filter — it is a map. It helps us mentor you, not evaluate you.</p>
